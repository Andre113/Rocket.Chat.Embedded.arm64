## Rocket.Chat on 64bit ARM Servers via Docker  (swarm mode or k8s compatible)

There are two directories:

* rocketchat
* compose

The steps that you need to follow are:

1. go into `rocketchat` and build the docker image (pushing it to your local registry)
1. go into `comnpose` and start up the server(s)

Please see README in each of the directories for further instructions.
